# VBA-Challenge
VBA Homework due 6/26

My VBA challenge for week two is in the filefolder "VBA-Challenge Finished" folder.  This folder holds the file Multiple_year_stock-data.xlsx.xlsm which will have the VBA code that I ran to pull the data out of the excel sheets.  There is also another folder called "Screenshots of the results" which have screen shots for each year.
